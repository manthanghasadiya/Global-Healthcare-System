## Problem Statement 
* Simplifying medical procedures by organising and preserving each user's health data.
* Connecting global health care system.
* For booking appointment, in hospital/clinic is very hectic task, and also it is not known to us where we should go for clinic in case of emergency..
* The government lacks a mechanism that can provide statistical data about each disease as well as data on the medicine supply chain.
* There is no system which help government to keep eye on country’s health system and citizens health.

## Solution
* We built a platform where anyone, including doctors, can register and login using their basic identity information.
* Higher authority can verify the doctors.
* Verified doctors have access to doctor’s panel. Where they can check patient’s appointments and also book appointment for themselves.
* They have access of patient’s full history.
* And also they are able to enter data on a current health issue and the patient's expenditure on that issue.
* Users can book their appointment with any doctor and they can also search for doctor by selecting doctor’s degree and speciality.
* Users can see their medical expenditure, for doctor’s fees and for medicines too.
